# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, a project I am continuously improving over time. The website serves as a platform to showcase my skills, experiment with web technologies and implement new ideas as they come to mind.

## Features
- **About Me**: A section to introduce myself and share my background.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my projects and work.
- **Contact**: A way for visitors to reach out to me.
- **Games**: A section to explore fun web-based games, including "Catch the Circle."

## Goals
- Enhance my web development skills by experimenting with new features and technologies.
- Create a dynamic and engaging platform to represent my personal and professional growth.
- Continuously add new sections and features based on my interests and ideas.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for a better experience.

## Future Plans
- Add a dedicated section for my skills and achievements.
- Experiment with animations and interactive elements.

Feel free to explore the website and provide feedback or suggestions!
